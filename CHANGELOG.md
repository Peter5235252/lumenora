# Changelog

## v0.5.0 - 2026-08-06

First public release with a graphical installer ISO.

Highlights:

- Signed, published container image at
  `ghcr.io/peter5235252/lumenora` (tags, e.g. `latest`, `44`,
  `20260806-44`), verified with Cosign.
- Graphical Anaconda installer ISO (bootc-generic-iso), attached to the
  release and uploaded as a workflow artifact.
- Rolling upstream inputs: Wayblue Hyprland `latest`, ML4W dotfiles `main`,
  latest Image Builder CLI.

Internal fixes leading to this release:

- Moved the canonical recipe to `recipes/recipe.yml` (BlueBuild only scans
  `config/` or `recipes/`); `scripts/validate.sh` and README updated.
- Moved `rebrand.sh` into `files/scripts/` (BlueBuild script module
  requirement); `Containerfile` updated.
- Fixed COPR repositories for `bazaar-store` (now `kylegospo/bazaar`) and
  `swww` (added `alebastr/sway-extras`); all `fedora-44`.
- Rotated the Cosign keypair to an unencrypted key; `SIGNING_SECRET` now holds
  raw PEM and `COSIGN_PASSWORD` is unset, matching BlueBuild's signer.
- Removed the generated `.bluebuild-scripts_*` directory from tracking and
  ignored it in `.gitignore`.
